<h1>Battlebot - Terms of Service</h1>
<p>Last Updated: November 2025</p>

<h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
<p>
By using Battlebot ("the Bot") in any Discord server, you agree to these Terms of Service.  
If you do not agree, do not use the Bot.
</p>

<h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
<p>
Battlebot is a Discord bot designed to assist with game coordination, including managing troop 
information, planning combat rallies, generating base layouts, creating event polls, and other 
game-related calculations.
</p>

<h2>3. Data the Bot Collects</h2>
<p>The Bot stores only the minimum data required for its features, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Discord User IDs</li>
    <li>Server (Guild) IDs</li>
    <li>Troop information voluntarily submitted by users</li>
    <li>Rally configuration data</li>
    <li>Event RSVP entries</li>
</ul>
<p>
The Bot does <strong>not</strong> collect or store messages, server logs, private messages, IPs, or 
any other personal information.
</p>

<h2>4. How Data Is Used</h2>
<p>
All stored data is used solely to provide in-server features such as combat planning, 
base planning, and event coordination.  
Data is not shared with third parties and is stored server-by-server (no cross-server linking).
</p>

<h2>5. Data Removal Requests</h2>
<p>
Users may request deletion of their stored data at any time by contacting the server owner or 
submitting a request to the bot developer.
</p>

<h2>6. Server Owner Responsibilities</h2>
<p>
Server owners are responsible for ensuring the Bot is used appropriately in their community 
and must not use the Bot for harassment, discrimination, or other harmful activities.
</p>

<h2>7. Availability & Reliability</h2>
<p>
The Bot is provided “as-is” without guarantees of uptime, accuracy, or performance.  
The developer may update, modify, or discontinue features at any time without notice.
</p>

<h2>8. Termination</h2>
<p>
The developer reserves the right to remove the Bot from any server that violates these terms 
or Discord’s Terms of Service.
</p>

<h2>9. Changes to These Terms</h2>
<p>
These Terms may be updated periodically. Continued use of the Bot after updates signifies 
acceptance of the revised terms.
</p>

<h2>10. Contact</h2>
<p>
To request data removal, report issues, or ask questions, contact the Bot developer via Discord.
